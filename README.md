# This project was written using node.js. The project can be run as follows: node BatterCard.js

# The code will output person,teams, stats and awards csv files utilizing statsapi.mlb.com. currently
# the playerID is hardcoded, but could be enhanced in the future to pull in a list of playerID's and loop
# through them to populate the data in the files.
